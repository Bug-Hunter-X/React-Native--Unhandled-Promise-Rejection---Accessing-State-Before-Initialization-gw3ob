# React Native: Unhandled Promise Rejection - Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where a state variable is accessed before it has been properly initialized by an asynchronous operation.  The problem occurs when a component attempts to render before the state update is completed, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

## Problem
The provided code attempts to render a component that depends on data fetched asynchronously.  Since the fetch operation is asynchronous, there's a race condition where rendering happens before the data is available.

## Solution
The solution involves using conditional rendering to only render the component's content once the state has been populated with data.  This prevents attempts to access the state variable while it's still null or undefined.
