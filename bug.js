This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when rendering a component before the state has had a chance to update.  Consider this example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    // ERROR: Trying to access this.state.data before it's set
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

In this scenario, `this.state.data` is accessed in `render` before the asynchronous `fetch` call in `componentDidMount` completes and updates the state. This leads to a runtime error or undefined behavior.
